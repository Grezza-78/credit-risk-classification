# credit-risk-classification

In this Challenge, I have used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I have used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

This Challenge has been divided into the following subsections:

* Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets

* Creating Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

* Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report - [Read the report here](https://github.com/Grezza-78/credit-risk-classification/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Analysis%20Report.md)
